# About the emiz_project-wp3-dicom_compliance Repository
This repository is associated with Work Package 3 of the GAP Enterprise Medical Imaging in Zambia Project.

## Introduction
The Medical Imaging Technology Association (MITA) has highlighted a set of criteria to consider, in medical imaging workflows, in order to effectively integrate AI in medical imaging, with conformance to the DICOM specification cited as an important point to consider (Medical Imaging Technology Association, n.d.).

There are a number of modalities generated in public health facilities in Zambia, however, the DICOM compliance levels of medical images generated are largely unknown. This Notebook includes Data Mining pipelines aimed at empirically determining the DICOM compliance levels of medical images generated in public health facilities in Zambia and, additionally, determining the feasibility of automatically classifying medical images using DICOM metadata.
